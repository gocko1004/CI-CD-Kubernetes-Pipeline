# **CI/CD Kubernetes Pipeline**  
**A Modern, Secure, and Scalable CI/CD Pipeline for Kubernetes Applications**

---

## **Overview**  
This project demonstrates a **robust CI/CD pipeline** designed specifically for Kubernetes-based applications. It integrates **security-first principles**, **code quality assurance**, **runtime monitoring**, and **infrastructure automation** to deliver scalable, containerized workloads efficiently. By leveraging modern DevSecOps tools and best practices, this pipeline ensures seamless application delivery while maintaining high standards of security and reliability.

---

## **Key Features**  
### **1. Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**  
- Automated provisioning of an **Amazon EKS cluster** using **Terraform**, ensuring consistent, repeatable, and scalable infrastructure deployment.  

### **2. Security-First Approach**  
- **Trivy** scans container images and file systems for vulnerabilities at multiple stages of the pipeline.  
- **Falco** monitors runtime behavior to detect anomalies and potential security threats in Kubernetes clusters.  

### **3. Code Quality Assurance**  
- **SonarQube** performs static code analysis to identify bugs, vulnerabilities, and code smells, ensuring clean, maintainable, and reliable code.  

### **4. Seamless Containerization**  
- **Docker** is used to build and host containerized applications, ensuring consistent and reproducible builds.  

### **5. Kubernetes Integration**  
- Applications are deployed using **Kubernetes manifests**, enabling efficient orchestration and management of containerized workloads.
